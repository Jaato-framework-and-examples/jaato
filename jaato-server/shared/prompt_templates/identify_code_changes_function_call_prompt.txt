You are analyzing a single COBOL modification log entry.
Your goal: explain the concrete code changed and provide a concise rationale.
If you need candidate changed lines, call the function changed_lines_tool with:
  description: the modification description text
  delimiter: the delimiter token (if any) that may appear near changed code
Do NOT invent code lines without calling the tool first if you need them.
You may call changed_lines_tool multiple times if necessary.
After obtaining any needed lines, produce a final explanation.
Return only natural language explanation (no JSON) and append a section:
"Likely affected lines:" followed by numbered lines IF you obtained tool results.
Modification metadata:
Date: {entry['date']}
Programmer: {entry['programmer']}
Change type: {entry['change_type']}
Description: {entry['description']}
