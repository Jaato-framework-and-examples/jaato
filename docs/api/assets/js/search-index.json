Overview Location: shared/plugins/subagent/ui_hooks.py The hooks allow UIs to: Track agent creation and lifecycle (active, done, error) Capture per-agent output in isolated buffers Monitor per-agent, per-turn token usage Track per-agent context consumption Maintain per-agent conversation history Track active tool calls in real-time (display below spinner) Both main agent and subagents use the same hook interface, ensuring consistent tracking across all agent types. Subagent Profile Configuration Subagent profiles are configured in the subagent plugin configuration. Each profile defines a specialized agent with specific capabilities, model settings, and visual representation. Profile Auto-Discovery Profiles can be automatically discovered from a directory (default: .jaato/profiles/ ). Each .json or .yaml file in this directory is parsed as a profile definition. # Directory structure .jaato/\n└── profiles/\n    ├── code_assistant.json\n    ├── research_agent.yaml\n    └── custom_agent.json Configuration options: auto_discover_profiles (boolean) - Enable/disable auto-discovery (default: true ) profiles_dir (string) - Directory to scan for profiles (default: .jaato/profiles ) Merge behavior: Discovered profiles are merged with explicitly configured profiles. Explicit profiles take precedence on name conflicts. Configuration Schema A subagent profile supports the following fields: { \"profiles\" : { \"code_assistant\" : { \"description\" : \"Analyzes and refactors code\" , \"plugins\" : [ \"cli\" , \"file_edit\" , \"grep\" ], \"plugin_configs\" : { \"cli\" : { \"allowed_commands\" : [ \"tree\" , \"cat\" , \"grep\" ]\n        }\n      }, \"system_instructions\" : \"You are a code analysis specialist...\" , \"model\" : \"gemini-2.5-flash\" , \"max_turns\" : 10, \"auto_approved\" : false , \"icon_name\" : \"code_assistant\" }, \"custom_agent\" : { \"description\" : \"Custom agent with unique icon\" , \"plugins\" : [ \"cli\" ], \"icon\" : [ \" ┌─┐  \" , \" │★│  \" , \" └─┘  \" ]\n    }\n  }\n} Profile Fields description (string, required) - Human-readable description of the agent's purpose plugins (array) - List of plugin names to enable (e.g., [\"cli\", \"file_edit\", \"web_search\"] ) plugin_configs (object) - Per-plugin configuration overrides system_instructions (string) - Additional system instructions for the agent model (string) - Model override (uses parent's model if not specified) max_turns (integer) - Maximum conversation turns before returning (default: 10) auto_approved (boo...",

It manages\n            connections to AI providers, coordinates tool execution, and maintains\n            conversation state. Overview The client follows a simple lifecycle: Create — Instantiate with a provider Connect — Establish connection to the AI model Configure — Set up tools and plugins Converse — Send messages and receive responses The client abstracts away provider-specific details, giving you a\n            consistent interface regardless of which AI service you're using. Basic lifecycle from shared import JaatoClient, PluginRegistry\n\n# 1. Create\nclient = JaatoClient()\n\n# 2. Connect\nclient.connect(\n    project=\"my-project\",\n    location=\"us-central1\",\n    model=\"gemini-2.5-flash\"\n)\n\n# 3. Configure\nregistry = PluginRegistry(model_name=\"gemini-2.5-flash\")\nregistry.discover()\nregistry.expose_tool(\"cli\")\nclient.configure_tools(registry)\n\n# 4. Converse\nresponse = client.send_message(\n    \"Hello!\",\n    on_output=lambda s, t, m: print(t, end=\"\")\n) Architecture The client sits between your application and the AI provider,\n            coordinating several components: Component Role ModelProvider Handles communication with AI services ToolExecutor Runs tools when the model requests them PluginRegistry Manages available tools and their schemas Session Maintains conversation history When you send a message, the client: Forwards the message to the provider Receives the response (text or tool calls) If tool calls: executes them and sends results back Repeats until the model returns final text Message flow You: \"List files...\" JaatoClient ModelProvider (sends to Gemini) Model returns: FunctionCall name=\"execute_command\" args={\"command\": \"ls\"} ToolExecutor (runs \"ls\") Model returns text: \"Here are the files in your directory...\" Response returned to you Conversation State The client maintains full conversation history internally. Each\n            message exchange adds to the history, enabling multi-turn conversations\n            with context. History Structure History is a list of Message objects, each containing: role — USER, MODEL, or TOOL parts — Content (text, function calls, results) Turn Boundaries A \"turn\" is one user message plus all model responses and tool\n            executions until the next user message.

Different AI services have different APIs, SDKs, and data formats.\n            The provider abstraction gives you: Portability — Switch providers without code changes Consistency — Same types everywhere Isolation — SDK details hidden Extensibility — Add new providers easily Your application code uses Message , ToolSchema ,\n            and ProviderResponse — never provider-specific types.

Understanding how tools work is key to\n            building powerful AI applications. What Are Tools? Tools (also called \"functions\") let the model: Execute shell commands Read and write files Search the web Call external APIs Interact with databases Anything you can program Without tools, the model can only generate text. With tools, it\n            can take action. Tools in action # Without tools:\n# User: \"What files are in my directory?\"\n# Model: \"I don't have access to your filesystem.\"\n\n# With tools:\n# User: \"What files are in my directory?\"\n# Model: [calls execute_command(\"ls\")]\n# Tool: \"file1.py\\nfile2.py\\nREADME.md\"\n# Model: \"Your directory contains:\n#         - file1.py\n#         - file2.py\n#         - README.md\" Anatomy of a Tool Every tool has three components: 1. Schema (ToolSchema) Describes the tool to the model: what it does and what parameters\n            it accepts. Uses JSON Schema format. 2. Executor (Function) The actual code that runs when the tool is called. Receives\n            parameters and returns a result. 3. Result (ToolResult) The output sent back to the model. Can be text, structured data,\n            or even images. Tool components from shared import ToolSchema, ToolResult\n\n# 1. Schema - tells model what the tool does\nschema = ToolSchema(\n    name=\"get_weather\",\n    description=\"Get current weather for a city\",\n    parameters={\n        \"type\": \"object\",\n        \"properties\": {\n            \"city\": {\n                \"type\": \"string\",\n                \"description\": \"City name\"\n            },\n            \"units\": {\n                \"type\": \"string\",\n                \"enum\": [\"celsius\", \"fahrenheit\"]\n            }\n        },\n        \"required\": [\"city\"]\n    }\n)\n\n# 2.

Tool plugins provide capabilities to the model and can be mixed\n            and matched freely. GC, session, and permission plugins affect\n            client behavior directly and require explicit configuration. Common Mistake Don't look for GC or session plugins in the registry's list_available() . They need to be created and\n            attached to the client directly.

Why Permissions? AI models are powerful but unpredictable.

Overview A plugin is a Python module that follows a simple protocol. At minimum,\n            it provides: Tool schemas — What tools are available Executors — Functions that run the tools Optionally, plugins can also provide user commands, auto-approved tools,\n            and prompt enrichment. Import Pattern Throughout this guide, examples use from jaato import ToolSchema .\n              This is the recommended import pattern for all plugins (both in-tree and external). When jaato is installed as a package, from jaato import ... imports\n              from the public API. The internal shared/ directory is an\n              implementation detail. Plugin structure # shared/plugins/my_plugin/\n#   __init__.py\n#   plugin.py\n\n# __init__.py\nfrom .plugin import create_plugin\n\n# plugin.py\nclass MyPlugin:\n    def initialize(self, config):\n        \"\"\"Called once with configuration.\"\"\"\n        pass\n\n    def get_tool_schemas(self):\n        \"\"\"Return list of ToolSchema.\"\"\"\n        return [...]\n\n    def get_executors(self):\n        \"\"\"Return dict of name -> callable.\"\"\"\n        return {...} Step 1: Create the Plugin Class Start by creating a new directory under shared/plugins/ with your plugin name. Then create the main plugin class. Required Members All plugins must implement these members to satisfy the ToolPlugin protocol.\n            The registry uses isinstance(plugin, ToolPlugin) at runtime and will reject\n            plugins missing any of these.

User Commands Only: This plugin provides commands for users\n            to invoke directly. It does not expose tools for the model to call. Overview The sandbox manager allows users to dynamically control which filesystem paths\n            the model can access during a session. It operates on a three-tiered configuration\n            model where session-level settings have the highest precedence. Configuration Levels Level Path Precedence Global ~/.jaato/sandbox_paths.json Lowest Workspace <workspace>/.jaato/sandbox.json Medium Session <workspace>/.jaato/sessions/<id>/sandbox.json Highest Session-level configurations can override global and workspace settings.\n            A path denied at the session level will be blocked even if allowed globally. User Commands sandbox list Displays all effective sandbox paths merged from all configuration levels.\n            Shows the path, action (ALLOW/DENY), and source level. sandbox add <path> Grants access to a path for the current session only. Adds <path> to session's allowed_paths Removes from denied_paths if present Changes take effect immediately sandbox remove <path> Blocks access to a path for the current session, even if allowed at\n            global or workspace level. Adds <path> to session's denied_paths Removes from allowed_paths if present Changes take effect immediately Registry Integration The plugin integrates with PluginRegistry for path validation: Allowed paths : Registered via registry.authorize_external_path() Denied paths : Registered via registry.deny_external_path() Validation : sandbox_utils.check_path_with_jaato_containment() checks denied paths first, so denial always takes precedence Plugin Protocol Method Returns get_tool_schemas() [] (no model tools) get_user_commands() [UserCommand(\"sandbox\", ...)] get_auto_approved_tools() [\"sandbox\"] get_system_instructions() None Configuration file format {\n  \"allowed_paths\": [\n    \"/path/to/allow\",\n    {\n      \"path\": \"/another/path\",\n      \"added_at\": \"2024-01-15T10:30:00Z\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"denied_paths\": [\n    \"/path/to/deny\"\n  ]\n} Example: sandbox list output Effective Sandbox Paths:\n\nPath                       ...",

Name filesystem_query Type Tool Plugin (Registry-managed) Tools Provided glob_files , grep_content User Commands None Auto-approved All tools (read-only) Features Glob Patterns : Find files with patterns like **/*.py Regex Search : Search file contents with regular expressions Structured Output : JSON responses with metadata Smart Exclusions : Skips node_modules , __pycache__ , etc. Background Support : Auto-backgrounds long searches Configurable : Customize exclusions, limits, and timeouts Primary Use Case Enables models to be self-sufficient when locating files without requiring\n            users to provide exact paths. The model can explore the codebase to find\n            relevant files before reading or editing them. Performance Trade-offs Let's be honest : Native CLI tools ( find , grep )\n            are faster—they're written in C and highly optimized. This plugin typically runs 2-5x slower than equivalent CLI commands. Why It's Still Worth It Benefit CLI Tools filesystem_query Output format Plain text, needs parsing Structured JSON with metadata Exclusions Manual --exclude flags Built-in (node_modules, .git, etc.) Shell escaping Complex quoting rules Direct patterns, no escaping Permissions Requires approval Auto-approved (read-only) Binary files Can output garbage Automatically skipped When Exclusions Help Automatic exclusions can make this plugin faster than naive CLI usage.\n            When users forget --exclude-dir=node_modules , they pay the price. Benchmark: glob_files vs find Find all Python files (500 files):\nglob_files:  avg=0.025s\nfind:        avg=0.009s\nRatio: 2.7x slower Exclusion efficiency Find JS files (with node_modules):\nglob_files (auto-exclude):  0.031s  (50 files)\nfind (no exclusions):       0.089s  (250 files)\nfind (with exclusions):     0.028s  (50 files)\n\nWhen node_modules is heavy, auto-exclusions\ncan actually be faster than naive CLI usage.
