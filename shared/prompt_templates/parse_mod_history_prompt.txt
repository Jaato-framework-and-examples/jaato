You are an expert COBOL maintenance analyst. Extract the modification history
comment entries from the following COBOL source. The layout may vary (different
columns, separators, markers like *, \"* HISTORY\", dashed lines, etc.).

Return ONLY JSON (no prose) as an array of objects. Each object MUST have exactly these keys:
{"date": "YYYY-MM-DD or best-effort", "programmer": "string or null", "description": "trimmed change description", "delimiter": "string or null"}
Omit speculative entries with confidence < 0.6.
"delimiter" is the literal separator / marker associated with the change (e.g. "-I", "-I/E", "-E", "-F", "-I/F" or a meaningful prefix used in the log). If no clear delimiter is present, set it to null.
The log entry itself may contain hints (including Spanish words) that point to the delimiter token; capture only the clean delimiter string (no surrounding asterisks or spaces).
Typical entry elements: user name, user code (pattern Uxxxxxx), date, description, delimiter token.

Example:
[{"date":"2024-03-11","programmer":"U123456","description":"Adjusted multi-currency rounding logic","delimiter":"MC-RND-I"}]
