Use the confluence-cli tool to locate in space SpainCrossDomainAS and provide a short 50-lines overview of the contents of one page whose title is "JSON processing at CICS". 

The command below should work fine and return you the page id:

confluence-cli search 'space.key=SpainCrossDomainAS AND title="JSON processing at CICS"'

Once you have a page id, this other command below should provide you the whole contents of the page:

confluence-cli content get 921354028

Otherwise, you can always attach the --help argument to the command to get understanding of how it works and how to use it.
