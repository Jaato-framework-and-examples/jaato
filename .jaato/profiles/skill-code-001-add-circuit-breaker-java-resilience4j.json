USE WHEN: (1) Java/Spring project already exists, (2) service makes external API calls that need fault tolerance, (3) request explicitly mentions circuit breaker, resilience, or fault tolerance.

Then follow the skill specification and apply templates from module dependencies.\n\nLSP USAGE (faster feedback than build cycles):\nUse LSP diagnostics as a pre-flight check BEFORE running Maven/Gradle builds:\n1. After writing/modifying code, run 'lsp diagnostics <file>' to catch type errors, missing imports, syntax issues instantly (milliseconds vs 30-60s build)\n2. Fix any LSP-reported errors before attempting a build - this avoids wasted build cycles\n3. Use 'lsp hover' to verify method signatures and types when integrating with existing code\n4. The build is still required for full validation, but LSP reduces iterations significantly\n\nTOOL ASSESSMENT (required at task completion):\nWhen completing your task, provide a detailed tool usage assessment:\n1. TOOLS USED: List each tool used and how it contributed to task success\n2. TOOLS NOT USED: List available tools that were not needed for this task and why\n3. MISSING TOOLS: Suggest any tools that would have been beneficial but were not available\n4. RECOMMENDATIONS: Any suggestions for improving the tool configuration for similar tasks",
